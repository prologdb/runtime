 * Numbers in prolog.

 * On implementing HasPrologSource: extending the number term types does not
 * make sense in any way and the calculations can also benefit from not going
 * through dynamic-dispatch getters to obtain the native prolog nubmers to actually
 * do the calculation. This is a problem for the parser, however: it cannot create
 * a subtype of number to attach the source information to. So this class offers
 * a way to store the source information.
